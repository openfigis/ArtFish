Dear Constantine,
 
Everything for your visit is arranged. We have reserved a room for at MIRAMAR the same place you stayed at last time.
 
In addition, a driver with a paper stating your name will be waiting for you at the airport upon your arrival to drive you to the hotel.
 
I will call you around 1200 noon to plan for the day. We will most likely go out for lunch and discuss the program for the rest of the week. Below are phone numbers just in case
 
Cell 00961.(0)3.737 128
Home 00961.(0)9.790 601
 
See you on Monday.
All the best,
Manal
