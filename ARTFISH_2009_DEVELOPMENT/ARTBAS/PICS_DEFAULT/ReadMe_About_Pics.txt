This folder contains the default set of ArtBasic backgrounds.

To use them, you removed the prefix 'DEF_' from the filename and then
copy them to the PICS_RUNTIME subdirectory.

Alternately, the graphics in the subdirectory PICS_USER may be renamed and 
copied into the PICS_RUNTIME subdirectory also if more 'personalized' 
backgrounds are desired.
